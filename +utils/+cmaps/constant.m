function cm = constant(Color, Resolution)
%cm = CONSTANT(Color) Create a colormap with a constant given RGB color.
%The map resolution is 256. Color can be a scalar, in that case it is
%interpreted as a color to assign to all the three channels.
%
%cm = CONSTANT(Color, Resolution) Also specifies the map resolution.
